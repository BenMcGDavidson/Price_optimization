# Price_optimization
Exploring various methods for determining optimal prices for products based on sales history and competitors' pricing

Here I explored using reinforcement learning through a deep-Q network (DQN), a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (RNN), and XGBoost regressor (XGBoost) methods. 
The DQN_main.py script relies on having the DQN_functions.py and DQNAgent.py availabe, as well as importing all required packages from requirements.txt.
The RNN_main.py script relies on having the NeuralNet_functions.py script as well as importing all required packages from requirements.txt.
XGBoost_price_optimization is a stand-alone script that only requires the associated requirements.txt.
